## NextJS

NextJS is a NodeJS with ReactJS based SSG framework, meaning that in order to use it's needed to install the following
dependencies.

1. First, install NodeJS: `sudo apt install nodejs`
2. Then, install npm (Node package manager): `sudo apt install npm`
3. Finally, using npm to install NextJS:
   `npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog â€”use-npm`

This command will install the additional dependencies required to develop a NextJS application, such as React. The pages
of this SSG are located in the /pages folder, and each page entrypoint has the same name as its corresponding file. As a
result, routing is handled automatically and everything is well-defined within the project.

There is no need to switch to a different file to view the routing pages or the names, as one folder contains all of
this information.

In addition, the fundamental feature of NextJS is that it uses React as a foundation framework to generate content via
components, and the page itself is a React component, so it's really simple to comprehend and begin working with if you'
re already familiar with React.

The styles, on the other hand, are covered by basic CSS files in a styles/ folder, as is customary in web development.

Overall, I found NextJS to be incredibly user-friendly, simple to design, utilize, and scale, and well-structured.
